Arduino Uno
The Arduino UNO acts as the central microcontroller for the entire system. It
processes input from the ultrasonic sensor, controls the motor, and communicates
with the LCD and LEDs. It runs the code that handles logic and decision-making
based on sensor data.
Role:
o Processes data from sensors.
o Controls motor speed.
o Manages display output and LED indicators.
o Executes the logic for safety alerts.

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance between the
vehicle (or system) and any obstacle ahead of it. This data is then used to adjust
the motor speed and trigger the LED indicators based on proximity.
Role:
o Sends ultrasonic waves and measures the time taken for the wave to
return (echo).
o Provides distance data to the Arduino, which is then used for decisionmaking
(e.g., stop or slow down the vehicle).
  
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) - I2C
The LCD is used to provide real-time feedback to the user. It displays the
distance from the obstacle and the motor speed for monitoring and
troubleshooting purposes.
Role:
o Displays key information such as current distance and speed.
o Enhances the user interface and provides a clear, visual representation
of the system's status.
  
DC Motor
The DC motor is responsible for driving the vehicle. Based on the sensor
input, it adjusts speed, or stops, depending on the distance detected by the
ultrasonic sensor.
Role:
o The motor is used to simulate the vehicle’s movement.
o Speed and direction of the motor are controlled via the Arduino based on
the obstacle distance.
  
Red and Green LEDs
Red LED and Green LED serve as visual indicators to alert the user about the
system’s status based on distance.
Red LED: Turns on when the vehicle is very close to an obstacle (danger zone).
Green LED: Turns on when the vehicle is at a safe distance.
Role:
o Provide clear, visual feedback to indicate whether the vehicle is safe or needs to stop/slow down.
  
Resistors (for LEDs)
Resistors are used to limit the current flowing through the LEDs, preventing them
from being damaged by excess current. Typically, 1kΩ resistors are used in series with
each LED.
Role:
o Protect the LEDs from excess current.
o Ensure the LEDs light up without burning out.
  
Wires and Breadboard
Wires and a breadboard are used for connecting all the components together
in a circuit.
Role:
o Wires connect the Arduino to the sensor, motor, LEDs, and LCD.
o The breadboard is used to make temporary connections for
prototyping and testing without the need for soldering.
