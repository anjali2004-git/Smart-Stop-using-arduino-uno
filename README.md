Smart Stop is a compact, low-cost safety system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and automatically control motor speed. It provides real-time feedback through LEDs and an LCD display, reducing collision risks at bus stops, crossings, and parking areas.
Abstract: 
In today's fast-moving world, ensuring vehicle safety at critical locations such as bus stops, parking areas, and pedestrian crossings is increasingly important. Accidents caused by sudden stops or misjudged distances are common, emphasizing the need for intelligent, automated solutions. The Smart Stop system addresses this need by offering a compact, reliable, and cost-effective setup that utilizes ultrasonic sensors to continuously monitor the surroundings. It ensures that the vehicle reacts appropriately to obstacles based on their proximity, minimizing the risk of collisions.
The system works by calculating the distance between the sensor and any obstacle, adjusting the motor speed dynamically based on how close or far the object is. When a nearby object is detected, the motor speed is reduced or completely stopped, and visual warnings are given through a red or green LED indicator system. An LCD display is also incorporated to provide real-time information about the measured distance and the motorâ€™s current speed, giving users instant feedback and improving operational awareness.
By combining simple components like an ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, a motor, and an LCD screen, Smart Stop demonstrates how even basic electronics can greatly enhance safety features. Its low cost, ease of implementation, and effectiveness make it a strong candidate for future expansion into more complex intelligent transportation systems. This project lays the groundwork for larger innovations, such as smart city transport networks and autonomous vehicle safety modules.
